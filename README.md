<p align="center"><b>Iris is a CLI-assistant that receives any type of input and tries to find an answer for it. It strives to have a simple codebase while being extremely performant and lightweight.</b></p>

**Note:**

Iris will take far longer than what I anticipated, the first working version will be released under 1.0.0 tag, see #1.

---

# Installation

For now, iris cannot be installed under a general binary, since it is still in alpha development.

If you want, however, build it to test yourself, you can. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Data

Iris will save all of its data into two folders which can be deleted at any time, the next run of Iris will create them again if necessary.

+ `~/.local/share/iris/`
+ `~/.cache/iris/`
