**Q: When will 1.0.0 come out?**

A: I don't know. It may take 6~ months, it may take a year. Iris aims are too big, but I am willing to do it, I believe there is much we can do with much less than we often do now, it doesn't mean necessarily that we have to sacrifice performance and convenience for it, is just means that it will take time and work, that I hope I may have in the future. I hope you can see the reasons why it is important to create this skeleton before anything else, those bare bones will be what will sustain Iris in the long-term.

**Q: What about proprietary assistant A, B and C?**

A: Iris does not aim to compete with proprietary assistants, it aims to be just a better assistant overall; offering answers you don't have to open a browser for in less than a second.

**Q: Why Iris was created?**

A: I've contributed to [**tuxi**](https://github.com/Bugswriter/tuxi/) until it wasn't maintainable any more, we strived to go too far with shell-scripting, which it shouldn't have happened. So we had to change our focus. David Sherriff made [oi](https://github.com/PureArtistry/oi/) in Rust way before [**tuxi**](https://github.com/Bugswriter/tuxi/) got to that point, which made [oi](https://github.com/PureArtistry/oi/) a better project to switch for at the time; but I wanted to do something that could be minimal, lightweight and could endure a long-term vision of performance and certain features, I saw this possible on modern C++, but not on Rust.

**Q: Google information not displaying at all or incorrectly?**

Google uses a complex system to limit requests, depending of language, country, and even the user-agent and of what words are being used it can block the information that is scraped.

However, it often fails, for more of a better word, it is a failure. Since Iris is open-source, Google can easily fix it behind the curtains and make Iris not able to scrape Google with the potentiality.

Nevertheless Google changes how the data is displayed, well, to be honest, it changes IDs, TAGs and CLASSEs. Which makes it impossible to create a stable version of Google scraping, so the workaround is to simply update it when it changes.

**Q: How I can get a prettier data with icons or lines, weather, etc...? Or show Images?**

A: You can't only with Iris. Iris gives you the information, what you do with it is on you. Some people may be interested to make external projects to prettify Iris output, but this will not be implemented on Iris itself.

**Q: Will there ever be a voice for Iris?**

A: No. That's it. Some people may be interested to use or make an external program to read this output like a human, but this will not be implemented on Iris itself.

**Q: Will there ever be a voice word-recognizer for Iris?**

A: No. That's it. Some people may be interested to use or make an external program to understand what you're saying and send to Iris, but this will not be implemented on Iris itself.

**Q: Too slow. What is it?**

A: Can be almost anything. Make an [issue]().

**Q: Why Iris is not telling me an information that is easily gathered in A web-site?**

A: This A website is either [not implemented](/#README.md?##Source) on Iris, or the information that A website displays now is displaying in a different manner. Make an [issue](sources).

**Q: Is Iris an AI?**

A: No, it aims to be an AI prototype, however we may go further down the line if feasible.

**Q: Why should I use Iris?**

A: I don't know what you want, that's the point of Iris, it doesn't force you to only use for certain things. If you are developer and just want to use Iris in an external program that display lyrics every time your music server changes a song, you can easily. If you are user and want the same, you can. Freedom is what you have with Iris and always will.

**Q: Why "Iris"?**

Iris comes from ["arco-íris"]() in Portuguese it is a word for rainbow, which Iris by itself is not colourful at all, but essentially it is what I want to represent with what it does. Iris is pronounced as "íris" in Portuguese.

**Q: Why C++?**

A: It is still has ecosystem that we can see foundations for this project. Iris uses the New C++ (C++20 and later versions), the modernized version where we can make less mistakes and offer much more performance and less time spending many things.

**Q: What are the limits of Iris?**

A: Many, primarily how information is gathered. Iris can never be really stabilized, since web-pages update how it display its data and Iris has to update as well to get this data, which by itself can take a long time doing, that's why every release will be considered a stable release.

**Q: What about feature A, B, or C?**

A: Make an [issue]() telling what it is and why it should be added.

**Q: What about collaborator A? Member B?**

A: We are all humans behind screens. Working for a project without any aim-for-profit. At the of the day, we strive to make a better project overall, not matter our differences ideologically or ethically. The world out there is just like here, we have to accept there are people that don't believe the same things we do and that's okay. 

**Q: How do I contribute to the project?**:

A: See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Q: How to donate and should I?**

A: If you can, please, don't hesitate. I see a bright future for this project, which means lots of work, there are many things that can be added and optimized as always, and to work on it takes a long time. I don't receive any money for this project, it is free (as in freedom) and use, so any help will be appreciated, thank you very much.
