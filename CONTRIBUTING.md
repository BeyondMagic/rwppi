Please, make an issue before starting to work on a pull request. This will tell others to not work on the same thing you do.

Please, do not by any means create a package on any package repository (such as [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org)) without warning an issue here and being approved.

Iris should not have features because it can, but only because it should, so think well if a new feature is really needed.

Remember that this project is not a tool we all endlessly aim for personal benefits. If we don't have a problem, there is not a solution to work on.

To any file modified under the `source` directory, the commit title is formatted in this style: `UNIT 0-7: ...` and the message: `...`.
